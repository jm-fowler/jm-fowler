### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Justin Fowler: justin.m.fowler@proton.me
I am a Student at Wake Tech, and I am creating this repo for CTI-110.
Although, at the moment there is only a README.md file in this repo, I will be adding classwork to it over time.
To clone this repo onto my local computer, I selected file-->clone repo-->insert URL-->clone repo.
