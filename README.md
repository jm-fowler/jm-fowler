### Hi there 👋

My name is Justin Fowler (justin.m.fowler@proton.me), and I am a student at Wake Technical Community College. I am making this repo for the class CTI-110. At the moment, there is only a README.md file in this repo, however, I will be adding classwork to it over time. Although I might also add some fun side projects over time as well.

To clone this repo onto my local computer, I selected file-->clone repo-->insert URL-->clone repo.
